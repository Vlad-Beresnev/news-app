# News Matter
---
### Description
Two years ago, I noticed my dad increasingly spent a significant amount of time scrolling through news on Telegram. While he did obtain useful information, the question arises: is it worth spending four or more hours on it?

To address this issue, I aim to create "News Matter." This platform will allow users to spend just an extra five minutes to understand what's happening in the world.

### Installation

2. To search for news, you can also use keywords to find news relevant to the topic mentioned above. Then, click "Search Key" to search by keywords.
